# Multiple Entries Feature Implementation Plan

**Date:** January 2025  
**Project:** Construction Inventory Bot  
**Feature:** Batch Stock Movement Processing  
**Status:** Implementation Phase (4/5 Complete)

## **Feature Overview**

Enable users to log multiple inventory entries simultaneously using enhanced `/in`, `/out`, and `/adjust` commands. This will significantly improve efficiency for bulk operations like receiving deliveries, site transfers, and inventory adjustments.

## **Requirements Summary**

- **Input Formats**: Newline-separated, semicolon-separated, and single entries
- **Commands**: Enhance existing `/in`, `/out`, `/adjust` to auto-detect batches
- **Movement Type**: All entries in a batch must be the same type
- **Error Handling**: Partial success with detailed error reporting
- **Feedback**: Comprehensive summary reports
- **Batch Limit**: Maximum 15 entries per batch
- **Use Cases**: Deliveries, site transfers, inventory adjustments

## **Implementation Phases**

### **Phase 1: Enhanced NLP Parser for Batch Detection**
**Duration**: 2-3 days  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  

#### **Objectives**
- Modify `NLPStockParser` to detect multiple entries
- Support newline and semicolon separators
- Validate batch consistency (same movement type)
- Enforce entry limits

#### **Technical Changes**
1. **Add batch detection methods**:
   - `detect_batch_format(text: str) -> BatchFormat`
   - `parse_batch_entries(text: str, user_id: int, user_name: str) -> BatchParseResult`
   - `validate_batch_consistency(movements: List[StockMovement]) -> bool`

2. **Enhance existing parser**:
   - Modify `parse_stock_command()` to handle both single and batch entries
   - Add batch size validation (max 15 entries)
   - Ensure all entries have consistent movement type

3. **New data structures**:
   - `BatchFormat` enum (SINGLE, NEWLINE, SEMICOLON, MIXED)
   - `BatchParseResult` with success/failure tracking
   - `BatchError` and `BatchErrorType` for error handling

#### **Implementation Details**
- **Batch Detection**: Automatically detects input format using newlines, semicolons, and movement type indicators
- **Smart Parsing**: Handles mixed formats (newlines + semicolons) intelligently
- **Movement Type Consistency**: Validates that all entries in a batch have the same movement type
- **Backward Compatibility**: Single entries continue to work exactly as before
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting for malformed batches
- **Performance**: Optimized for maximum batch size of 15 entries

#### **Test Results**
✅ **All 20 tests passing** including:
- Batch format detection (single, newline, semicolon, mixed)
- Batch parsing with various formats
- Movement type consistency validation
- Backward compatibility for single entries
- Edge case handling and error scenarios
- Performance validation with maximum batch sizes

#### **Test Plan for Phase 1**

**Unit Tests**:

- Test newline-separated batch detection
- Test semicolon-separated batch detection
- Test mixed format detection
- Test batch size validation (reject >15 entries)
- Test movement type consistency validation
- Test malformed batch input handling

**Integration Tests**:

- Test error handling for invalid batch formats
- Test performance with maximum batch size

**Test Cases**:
```
# Single entry (should work as before)

# Newline batch (should detect as batch)
/in cement, 50 bags, from supplier
steel bars, 100 pieces, from warehouse
safety equipment, 20 sets, from office

# Semicolon batch (should detect as batch)
/in cement, 50 bags, from supplier; steel bars, 100 pieces, from warehouse

# Mixed format (should detect as batch)
/in cement, 50 bags, from supplier
steel bars, 100 pieces, from warehouse; safety equipment, 20 sets

# Invalid: mixed movement types (should reject)
/in cement, 50 bags, from supplier
/out steel bars, 100 pieces, to warehouse

# Invalid: too many entries (should reject)
/in item1, 1 piece; item2, 1 piece; ... (16+ items)
```
