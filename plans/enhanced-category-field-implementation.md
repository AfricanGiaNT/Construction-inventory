## Overview

This plan implements an enhanced category field system that automatically categorizes construction materials using intelligent parsing, supports hierarchical organization, and provides powerful search and reporting capabilities. The system will transform the current basic category field into a smart material description system that groups items into logical material families.

## Problem Statement

**Current Limitations:**
- All items currently show "Steel" as category (likely a default/placeholder value)
- No intelligent categorization based on item names or characteristics
- Limited search and filtering capabilities by material type
- No hierarchical organization for related materials
- Users cannot easily group or find items by material family

**Example Scenarios:**
- "Paint 20ltrs" should automatically be categorized as "Paint"
- "Copper Wire 100m" should be "Electrical > Cables"
- "PVC Pipe 3m" should be "Plumbing"
- Users should be able to search `/search category:Paint` to find all paint items
- Inventory summaries should group items by material category

## Solution Design

### Enhanced Category System Features

1. **Smart Parsing Engine**: Automatically detect material categories from item names
2. **Hierarchical Structure**: Support main categories and subcategories
3. **Dynamic Creation**: Automatically create new categories when users input them
4. **Enhanced Search**: Filter and search by category with natural language commands
5. **Reporting**: Group items by material type in summaries and reports

### Smart Parsing Priority Rules

1. **Exact Matches**: "Paint" â†’ "Paint", "Wire" â†’ "Electrical > Cables"
2. **Context Clues**: "Electrical Paint" â†’ "Paint" (paint is more specific than electrical)
3. **Material Type**: "Copper Wire" â†’ "Electrical > Cables" (wire is always electrical)
4. **Function**: "Hammer" â†’ "Tools" (function-based categorization)
5. **Fallback**: Create new category if no clear match
