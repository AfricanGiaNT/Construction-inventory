# Search Algorithm Precision Enhancement Implementation

**Project**: Construction Inventory Bot  
**Feature**: Enhanced Search Algorithm for Stock Queries  
**Implementation Date**: September 10, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Version**: 1.0

## Overview

This document details the implementation of a precision-focused search algorithm enhancement for the Construction Inventory Bot's `/stock` command. The enhancement addresses critical issues with search result relevance by implementing word-level matching and increasing similarity thresholds.

## Problem Statement

### **Critical Issues Identified**:

1. **Poor Search Relevance**: 
   - Search for "reflectors" returned 67 results (16.5% of database)
   - Many results were completely irrelevant (e.g., "Green boards", "Electrical invertors")
   - Users were overwhelmed with irrelevant results

2. **Flawed Similarity Algorithm**:
   - Used `SequenceMatcher` for character-level matching
   - Matched on partial character sequences, not semantic meaning
   - "reflectors" vs "Green boards" = 0.545 similarity (should be ~0.0)

3. **Inappropriate Threshold**:
   - 0.3 threshold was too permissive
   - Allowed 16.5% of all items to match any query
   - No semantic filtering or word-level validation

### **User Impact**:
- Users had to scroll through pages of irrelevant results
- Search was essentially unusable for precise queries
- Poor user experience and reduced productivity

## Solution Design

### **Core Improvements**:

1. **Word-Level Matching**:
   - Split queries and item names into individual words
   - Match actual words, not character sequences
   - Require meaningful word overlap for relevance

2. **Higher Precision Threshold**:
   - Increased from 0.3 to 0.5
   - Reduced false positives significantly
   - Maintained relevant results

3. **Smart Scoring System**:
   - Exact word matches: 0.8 weight
   - Partial word matches: 0.4 weight
   - Boosts for items starting with query
   - Boosts for items containing full query

4. **Semantic Filtering**:
   - Require at least one meaningful word match
   - Reject results with no semantic relationship
   - Focus on actual item relevance

## Implementation Details

### **Files Modified**:

#### 1. `src/services/stock_query.py`

**Enhanced `_calculate_similarity()` method**:

```python
def _calculate_similarity(self, query: str, item_name: str) -> float:
    """
    Calculate similarity between query and item name using word-level matching.
    """
    query_lower = query.lower().strip()
    item_lower = item_name.lower().strip()
    
    # Exact match gets highest score
    if query_lower == item_lower:
        return 1.0
    
    # Split into words for word-level matching
    query_words = [word.strip() for word in query_lower.split() if word.strip()]
    item_words = [word.strip() for word in item_lower.split() if word.strip()]
    
    if not query_words or not item_words:
        return 0.0
    
    # Check for exact word matches first
    exact_word_matches = 0
    partial_word_matches = 0
    
    for query_word in query_words:
        # Check for exact word match
        if query_word in item_words:
            exact_word_matches += 1
        else:
            # Check for partial word match
            for item_word in item_words:
                if query_word in item_word or item_word in query_word:
                    partial_word_matches += 1
                    break
    
    # Calculate base score based on word matches
    total_query_words = len(query_words)
    exact_match_ratio = exact_word_matches / total_query_words
    partial_match_ratio = partial_word_matches / total_query_words
    
    # Base score: exact matches are worth more than partial matches
    base_score = (exact_match_ratio * 0.8) + (partial_match_ratio * 0.4)
    
    # Require at least one meaningful match
    if exact_word_matches == 0 and partial_word_matches == 0:
        return 0.0
    
    # Boost for items that start with the query
    if item_lower.startswith(query_lower):
        base_score += 0.2
    
    # Boost for items that contain the full query as substring
    if query_lower in item_lower:
        base_score += 0.1
    
    # Boost for items where all query words are found
    if exact_word_matches == total_query_words:
        base_score += 0.1
    
    # Cap at 1.0
    return min(base_score, 1.0)
```

**Updated similarity threshold**:

```python
# Filter out very low similarity scores (below 0.5 for better precision)
filtered_items = [(item, score) for item, score in scored_items if score >= 0.5]
```

### **Key Algorithm Changes**:

1. **Word-Level Processing**:
   - Split both query and item names into words
   - Process each word individually
   - Calculate meaningful word overlap

2. **Scoring Weights**:
   - Exact word matches: 80% weight
   - Partial word matches: 40% weight
   - Additional boosts for prefix matches and full query containment

3. **Semantic Validation**:
   - Require at least one meaningful word match
   - Reject results with zero word overlap
   - Focus on actual semantic relevance

4. **Precision Threshold**:
   - Increased from 0.3 to 0.5
   - Significantly reduced false positives
   - Maintained relevant results
